# Architecture Decisions

## 2026-02-21 - Config Sync: Strip host-only fields with generic stripJSONKeys()

**Context**: Screenshots from VM testing showed 5 errors: `installMethod is native` (directory/binary not found), `22 plugins failed to install`, `Not logged in`, `~/.local/bin not in PATH`. Root cause: host config files synced verbatim to VM contain fields that reference host-specific state.
**Decision**: Refactored `stripMCPServers()` into generic `stripJSONKeys(data, keys)`. Added `stripHostOnlyFields()` (strips `mcpServers`, `installMethod`, `oauthAccount` from ~/.claude.json) and `stripSettingsForVM()` (strips `enabledPlugins`, `hooks` from settings.json).
**Consequences**: VM gets clean config. `installMethod` auto-detected by Claude Code. No plugin install failures. Host hooks don't pollute VM. OAuth state removed (API key auth via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var forwarded through SSH SendEnv). Belt-and-suspenders: Vagrantfile provisioning also creates `~/.local/bin` and symlinks claude binary.

## 2026-02-21 - Skill Rewrite: "operating-in-vagrant" (Supercharged Claude)

**Context**: Existing `vagrant-sudo` skill was functional but didn't capture the "Supercharged Claude" mindset from emilburzo's blog post. Skill best practices (platform.claude.com) recommend: concise, gerund naming, capabilities-first, proper discovery metadata.
**Decision**: Rewrote skill as `operating-in-vagrant`. Leads with unrestricted capabilities (sudo, Docker, system config, global packages). Includes host networking (10.0.2.2), common Docker patterns, and a "Mindset" section encouraging bold experimentation. Renamed file from `vagrant-sudo.md` to `operating-in-vagrant.md`.
**Consequences**: Claude inside VM should be more proactive about using sudo, Docker, and system tools. Better skill discovery via descriptive frontmatter. Credential guard hook still enforced separately via settings.local.json.

## 2026-02-21 - MCP in Vagrant VM: Use @modelcontextprotocol packages via STDIO

**Context**: MCP tools were not loading inside the Vagrant VM. Host-side configs synced into VM referenced `agent-deck mcp-proxy` and Unix pool sockets that don't exist in the VM. 14 MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` all pointed to host-only binaries.
**Decision**: Clean all `mcpServers` from global/user Claude configs inside VM. Install official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` npm packages globally. Configure project-level `.mcp.json` with STDIO transport using `npx -y` invocations.
**Consequences**: MCP servers run natively inside VM. No dependency on host-side agent-deck or pool sockets. Packages cached globally via `npm install -g` to avoid repeated npx downloads. Node.js 18.x works despite engine warnings for 20+.

## 2026-02-21 - Created vagrant-vm-setup skill for Claude Code in Vagrant

**Context**: Running Claude Code inside a Vagrant VM has multiple non-obvious constraints (broken host MCPs, inotify limitations, credential guards, networking). Need a reusable skill to document these patterns.
**Decision**: Created `vagrant-vm-setup` skill at `.claude/skills/vagrant-vm-setup/` with progressive disclosure: SKILL.md (main guide), MCP-SETUP.md (detailed MCP installation), TROUBLESHOOTING.md (common issues). Follows Anthropic skill best practices (concise, one-level references, under 500 lines).
**Consequences**: Claude Code automatically loads the skill when operating in VM context. New sessions get immediate guidance on constraints and MCP setup. Skill is project-local (not global).

## 2026-02-21 - Vagrant Config Sync: Strip mcpServers from host configs

**Context**: `SyncClaudeConfig()` copies `~/.claude/.claude.json` and `~/.claude.json` into the VM. These contain `mcpServers` definitions that reference host-local binaries (npx, node packages) which don't exist inside the VM, causing all 14 MCPs to fail.
**Decision**: Add `stripMCPServers()` that removes the `mcpServers` key from JSON config before writing to VM. MCP config for the VM should come exclusively from the project-level `.mcp.json` generated by `WriteMCPJson`.
**Consequences**: Clean MCP state in VM. Host MCPs don't pollute VM config. STDIO MCPs still need npm packages installed in VM provisioning to work via `.mcp.json`.

## 2026-02-21 - Vagrant Command Wrapping: Simplified tmux-free command

**Context**: `buildClaudeCommand()` generates commands containing `tmux set-environment CLAUDE_SESSION_ID "$session_id"` which fails inside the VM (no tmux server). Error: `error connecting to /tmp/tmux-1000/default`.
**Decision**: Add `buildVagrantClaudeCommand()` that produces a clean command using `export` instead of `tmux set-environment`. Called from `applyVagrantWrapper` instead of wrapping the tmux-dependent command.
**Consequences**: No tmux errors inside VM. Session ID available via env var. Host-side tmux session ID capture still works (via `tmux.SetEnvironment` after `Start()`).

## 2026-02-21 - Vagrant Visual Badge: Blue [Vagrant] indicator

**Context**: Vagrant sessions need visual distinction from normal sessions.
**Decision**: Added `ColorBlue` (#2ac3de dark / #166775 light) to theme. `[Vagrant]` badge in session list (bold blue, follows YOLO/worktree pattern). Blue pill badge in preview pane (next to tool/group badges).
**Consequences**: Consistent with existing badge patterns. New color available for future use.

## 2026-02-14 - Vagrant Mode: Wrapper Command Approach (Approach 1)

**Context**: User wants a "Just do it" checkbox that spawns Claude Code in an isolated Vagrant VM with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and sudo access. Three approaches evaluated by multi-perspective brainstorm.
**Decision**: Wrapper Command approach -- add checkbox, auto-manage VM lifecycle, wrap commands via `vagrant ssh -c`. No provider abstraction, no security hardening beyond VM isolation.
**Consequences**: Minimal complexity (4 modified + 3 new files). VirtualBox dependency. First boot latency (5-10 min). Bidirectional sync risk accepted as intentional.

## 2026-02-14 - Vagrant Mode: Force skip-permissions when vagrant mode enabled

**Context**: Should the user be able to disable `--dangerously-skip-permissions` while in vagrant mode?
**Decision**: Force it on automatically. The entire purpose of vagrant mode is unrestricted access in a safe sandbox.
**Consequences**: Simpler UX. Users who want restricted mode should not use vagrant mode.

## 2026-02-14 - MCP Compatibility: VM-Aware Config Generation

**Context**: MCP tools configured in agent-deck need to work inside the Vagrant VM, but `.mcp.json` references host-side resources (localhost URLs, Unix sockets, host commands).
**Decision**: Generate a VM-specific `.mcp.json` via `WriteMCPJsonForVagrant()` that rewrites HTTP URLs (`localhost` -> `10.0.2.2`), bypasses pool sockets (STDIO fallback), and provisions npm MCP packages in the Vagrantfile. Global/user Claude configs propagated via `SyncClaudeConfig()`.
**Consequences**: HTTP MCPs work out of the box. STDIO MCPs require npm packages installed in VM. Non-npm MCPs (python, custom binaries) need manual VM provisioning. Pool sockets always bypassed (higher memory usage per session).

## 2026-02-14 - Crash Recovery: VM Health Check in UpdateStatus()

**Context**: Vagrant VM can crash independently of agent-deck. Need to detect and surface VM failures.
**Decision**: Periodic health check (60s interval) piggybacked on existing `UpdateStatus()` polling. Uses `vagrant status --machine-readable` with in-memory caching. Contextual error messages per VM state. Press R triggers state-aware recovery (resume/destroy+up/reload).
**Consequences**: ~100-200ms overhead every 60s for vagrant sessions. Claude conversations survive VM destruction (session ID stored server-side). `vagrant resume` used for suspended VMs (5s vs 30-60s).

## 2026-02-14 - Crash Recovery: agent-deck Crash is Automatic

**Context**: What happens when agent-deck itself crashes while a vagrant session is running?
**Decision**: No special handling needed. tmux session survives, VM survives, Claude survives. On restart, `ReconnectSessionLazy()` reconnects to existing tmux session. `HealthCheck()` confirms VM state on next poll.
**Consequences**: Zero-effort recovery for agent-deck crashes. Only edge case: crash during `vagrant up` before Claude launches -- handled by restart flow detecting partial VM state.
